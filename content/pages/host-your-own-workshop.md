Overview
--------

The following materials were used to plan this IAP course in January 2017.

Github
------

We were sponsored by [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/) with free private repos.

For the course we created a [single repo](https://mens-et-manus.github.io/archive/2017-IAP-Arduino-Unity/) and gave every student access to it. We populated it with simple html templates and folders for each student and group.

Hardware
--------

*   Each student should have access to a laptop or computer with Unity and Github installed
*   Each team needs regular access to a computer that is running the Unity+Kinect setup for 2x 30–45 minute periods before each project. To figure out how many full Kinect+Unity setups you need follow this formula: "number of setups needed" = ("number of teams" \* "number of minutes each team needs to use a setup") / ("total number of minutes teams have for testing their game on setup"). Say we have 4 teams that have 6 hours for the short project, 3–4 hours will be spent building the games on the laptops and hooking up the Kinect library without needing the full setup. Then, we have 2 hours for 6 teams to test their game on a setup, so if we want teams to have 40 minutes for testing we need 6\*40/120=2 full setups.
*   A full Kinect+Unity setup includes:
    *   Microsoft Kinect sensor
    *   Compatible USB 3.0 port
    *   Computer with sufficient CPU, RAM and GPU

Emails
------

We setup a mailing list for the course and signed up students for the list. This allowed us to communicate to the class as a whole, and allowed students to communicate with each other during the course. Following are some of the emails we sent to participants.

### A few days before

"Just confirming that you are enrolled in the videogame design class for IAP that will meet January 9–13 and 17–20 in room 13-3101 from 1 PM–4 PM."

### A few days before

"This is the email list for our IAP video game design class. We are looking forward to meeting everyone on Monday in room 13-3101 at 1 PM.

Before arriving on Monday please download and install the Unity game engine on the laptop computer you will be using for the class. You can get the free [personal version](https://store.unity.com/).

We will do a brief intro to Github as one option for collaborating with others on your projects, so please also [download the GitHub client](http://desktop.github.com/) from and setup a github account if you do not already have one.

We will walk you through an introductory Unity tutorial about building a 3D game over the first few days, then you will break out into teams for a small two day project meant to help you learn through collaboration. We'll present the course outline in more detail during the first day."

### Day before

"Just a friendly reminder to install Unity before class, it takes a long time even on fast computers!"

### .gitignore

"I think it is good to share with you, in particular for git beginners. According to the [Unity website](https://answers.unity3d.com/questions/22604/which-unity-project-files-can-be-ignored-for-versi.html), you should modify your .gitignore to exclude temporary, meaningless files to stage/add into your repository for sharing your codes across team members. Tracking temporary/binary files can cause nightmare for your friends."

### .gitignore

"We had a nightmare to fix merging conflicts since unity has many binary files.  
We should [use smart merge](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SmartMerge.html) rather than standard git merge. Using smart merge is also tricky; we should [run 'git mergetool.'](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35140856/setup-unity-smart-merge)  
As well as .gitignore and .gitattributes, you also need to set up .git/config or .gitconfig to run mergetool.  
More detail discussion to work better is provided under the topic '[Using Git with Unity](https://gist.github.com/Ikalou/197c414d62f45a1193fd).'  
It suggests to [change your Unity editor setting](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-EditorManager.html) to force text files for .asset; Edit > Project Settings > Editor Settings > Asset Serialization > Force Text."

### Project request

Super awesome presentations! Please please please send me a copy of your final project!!!!

Registration Forms
