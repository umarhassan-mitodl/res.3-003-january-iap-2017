## Overview

Students form groups of three to four and work for twenty hours on a long project. We help facilitate this by discussing techniques for collaborative design, guiding the class in an improv activity, lead a brainstorming activity for the whole class to help students identify collaborators, allow students ample time to self-organize into teams. Students then have twenty hours of class time to develop an idea for a videogame, to create the game, and to prepare to present about their game in front of external visitors. The capstone of the class is a final five-minute presentation that each group must give about their game in front of the entire class and external visitors.

The following project demonstrations are courtesy of the participants, including MIT students, and used with permission.
