## Instructor Insights

{{< quote "Technical skills take a long time to develop; you can’t turn people into developers in two weeks. But you can teach life skills in that time, so one of our goals for this experience is for participants to leave the workshop valuing themselves as learners." "— Kyle Keane and Andrew Ringler" >}}
